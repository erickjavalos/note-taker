# Note Taker 

## Description

The intent of this application is to be able to develop a note taker application that helps write and save notes to local cache. 

Upon clicking on a new note, you will be shown two areas to put a description/subject, and the contents of the note. One can then save the note
and view it on the left dashboard. In addition to this, a user is also able to delete notes by pressing the red trash icon next to the note in the dashboard.
